# 1. copy this file, make changes there and source that in your configs instead
# 2. source this file in another file, make changes there, source that instead
#
# the latter option being preferred as future upstream additions to this file

# How long to sleep to allow droplet time to complete setup--30 seconds usually
# works well, but 45 is better when response times are slow. If ssh times out
# or apt complains about another process having a lock or build tools are
# missing you can increase this. If you aren't installing any Ubuntu packages
# you can decrease this.
